## Project Objectives

### Learn the basics of Java:

The primary goal of this project was to apply the skills acquired while learning object-oriented programming and C++ to learn Java effectively.

## Features

### Easy mode:

Warm up your typing skills with a simple sentence.

### Normal mode:

Challenge yourself with a word bank comprising over 20 medium-difficulty programming-related words. The words are randomly arranged each time you run the program.

### Hard mode:

Test your typing skills with a word bank containing over 20 hard-difficulty programming-related words. Like in Normal Mode, the words are shuffled for a fresh challenge every time.
